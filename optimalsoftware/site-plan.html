      <h1>The best solutions, for the best Companies. </h1>
      <p>
        As our technological world grows, so does the need for “more”. Whether it is more speed, power, or performance, we are continually asking for more. Automated software has grown, and continues to grow, over the years, as it is assisting companies with increasing revenue and productivity.  Because the “more” a software is capable of, the more a company profits. Not only monetarily, but in customer size and reputation
      </p>
      <p>
        Optimal software uses the best technologies at the moment to provide companies with the best software solutions to streamline their processes. Using the proper software, and having a holistic vision of the company we can “push-up” the revenue by increasing their productivity with less investment. For example, if they want to double their revenue, they don’t need to double their assets, they need instead, to stop using brute force and let us provide them the tools that will help them and their teams to work smarter not harder.

      <h3>Solutions</h3>
      <h3>Optimal software makes it easy to increase a company's performance, using the best software solutions so they can get down with their goals faster.</h3>
      <h4>Web Development</h4>
      <p>
        Optimal software uses the best web development practices and patterns to help the companies streamline their processes not only locally but globally if needed.  They don’t need to use boring and insecure templates. When web pages are developed with custom codes, it offers greater security against attacks as it reduces vulnerabilities. We assure the integrity of the web pages and the information of our customers as a testament to our legitimacy.
      </p>
      <h4>Database design</h4>
      <p>
        We help companies to deal with large amount of data. Providing them with the fastest access to the information they need. Also, we can reduce the amount of time you spend managing data, analyze data in a variety of ways and improve the quality and consistency of information. With this information we can help them know how their business is performing and what to focus on.
      </p>
      <h4>ERP Solutions – Integrations</h4>
      <p>
        If something is working well, it does not mean that it could not work better. We can use the tools the companies are already using and enable them to use them in a better way integrating new tools and solutions. We have standard connectors and integrations with almost all required enterprise and third-party solutions. We are constantly adding integrations – if they need one that’s not here, we’ll build it for them during the implementation.
      </p>
      <h4>Mobile apps</h4>
      <p>
        Mobile applications are way faster than mobile websites. Even a well-groomed and optimized responsive mobile website cannot match with the speed of an app. Businesses are all about giving the service as fast as possible today. A slight lag can cause massive loss and that leads to customer discontent. We can enable companies to have a faster operation, allow them to provide a personalized experience to their clients, send instant updates and notification and to enhanced user interaction.
