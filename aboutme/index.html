            <p>Hello everyone! I'm Nelson Daniel Petro Doria, I am 24 years old and I am from Colombia. I am not married yet, sadly.</p>
            <p>I have been member of The Church of Jesus Christ my whole life. I served a mission in Paragya since 2019 to 2021 uring a global pandemic. I have to admit that it was an awesome experience.</p>
            <p>Currently I am working as a Data Quality Specialist for an US company. I am a manufacturer engineer but things here in Colombia are little difficult to find a job. I was blessed with the opportinity to find a remote job.</p>
            <p>I love coding I know how to code in Python, C and C++, but I still need to learn OOP. I want to become an awesome web developer, complete a bacherlo's degree, a master degree and a PhD degree. I hope I can achieve all those goals.</p>
